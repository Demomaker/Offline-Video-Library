# Offline-Video-Library
This is a Desktop Video Library developed in C# and WPF and can only be used on Windows.
It has taken me about a year to make this, but now it is stable enough to be released!

Here are the main features of this program : 
- Upload videos to store them in a common place.
- Locate a video uploaded on your computer with its displayed path in the app.
- Watch videos in the library to be sure the videos you see are the ones you want.
- Add a custom title and a custom description to a video to better identify it.
- Search for videos by their filename or their title.
- Delete videos from the library that you didn't want to keep in it.
- Do this all while being offline.
